		<h1>What are Chengyu?</h1>
		<p>
			Chengyu are a form of Chinese idiomatic expression. Most Chengyu consist of 4 characters and have a fixed meaning. They often have a story associated with them, that tells you how the Chengyu came about.
			There are over 20,000 different Chengyu, though only about 5,000 are commonly used in the Chinese language. <br>
			Even though Chengyu originate from, or were most commonly used in Classical Chinese, they remain widely used in vernacular Chinese. Being able to understand and use Chengyu adds to the sophistication of one's understanding of the Chinese language.

		<h1>How do I use this website?</h1>
		<p>
			If you click on the "List of Chengyu" on the top of this page, you are directed to a list of all the Chengyu I have collected so far. <br>
			Click on one of the Chengyu to find out what it is all about. Each page lists the pinyin, the English translation (literally and figuratively), the story of the Chengyu in Mandarin as well as in English and finally, examples of how to use the Chengyu in a sentence.

			Happy Learning!
