        <h1>How this website came about</h1>
        <p>
            In the summer of 2020, I had just finished my university degree and was spending the summer at home in Germany. <br>
            I always wanted to learn more Chengyu, as a way to improve the sophistication of my Mandarin. But at the same time, I also wanted to pick up some new skills, ideally related to programming or web development.
            Put two and two together, and so the idea of hosting a website to learn Chengyu and Web Development at the same time was born. <br>
            <br>
            Many thanks go to Zhenghong (<a href="https://lieuzhenghong.com/">lieuzhenghong.com</a>) who has helped me coming up with ideas and the necessary implementation to make this Website possible.
