                <p class="story">
                   
                    战国时期，秦军在长平一线大胜赵军。秦军主将白起领兵乘胜追击，包围了赵国都城邯郸。大敌当前，赵国形势万分危急。平原君赵胜奉赵王之命去楚国求兵解围。
                    <br>
                    平原君把门客召集起来，想挑选20个文武全才一起去，他挑了又挑，选了又选，最后还缺一个人。这时，门客毛遂自我推荐，说：“我算一个吧！”平原君见毛遂再三要求，才勉强同意了。
                    <br>
                    到了楚国，楚王只接见平原君一个人。两人坐在殿上，从早晨谈到中午还没有结果。毛遂大步跨上台阶，远远地大声叫起来：“出兵的事，非利即害，非害即利，简单而又明白，为何议而不决？”  楚王非常恼火，问平原君：“此人是谁？”平原君答道：“此人名叫毛遂，乃是我的门客！” 楚王喝道：“赶快下去！我和你主人说话，你来干什么？” 
                    <br>
                    毛遂见楚王发怒，不但不退下，反而又走上几个台阶，他手按宝剑说：“如今十步之内，大王性命在我手中！”楚王见毛遂那么勇敢，没有再呵斥他，就听毛遂讲话。毛遂就把出兵援赵有利出国的道理，做了个非常精辟的分析。毛遂的一番话，说得楚王心悦诚服，答应马上出兵。不几天，楚、魏等国联合出兵援赵。秦军撤退了。

        <h2>Story in English</h2>
            <p class="story">
                During the Warring States Period, the Qin Army defeated Zhao Jun. The army leader of Qin, Ban Qi, led the troops to encircle Handan, the capital of the state of Zhao. 
                The situation was critical. Lord Pingyuan was ordered by the king of Zhao to go to the Chu state and ask for rescue.
                <br>
                Lord Pingyuan summoned his men, he wanted to choose 20 men with civil and military skills to go with him. He picked and chose, but there was one person lacking. 
                At this moment, Moa Sui came forward and recommended himself, and said: "I count as one, no?" After Mao Sui asked three times, Lord Pingyuan finally agreed.
                <br>
                When they arrived in the state of Chu, the king there only met with Pingyuan. The two of them sat together and talked from morning till evening but without results. 
                <br>
                Mao then strode with large steps and shouted from the distance: "The matter of sending troops is simply and clear, why haven't you decided yet?" The king of Chu was very angry and asked Pingyuan: "Who is this guy?"
                Pingyuan replied: "This is Mao Shui, and is one of my men." The king of Chu replied: "Quick, go away! I am talking to your Lord, what are you doing here?"
                <br>
                Seeing that the king of was angry, not only did Mao Sui not retreat, but he even came up a couple of stairs, pressed his hand unto his sword and said: "Within ten steps, the life of the king is in my hands!"
                <br>
                When the king of Chu saw that Mao Sui was so brave, he did not scold him anymore and listened to what he had to say.
                Mao Sui then incisively analysed the reason for sending troops to assist the state of Zhao. Mao Sui's remarks convinced the king of Chu, and he agreed to quickly send troops.
                <br>
                After just a few days, Chu, Wei and other countries jointly sent troops to assist Zhao. The Qin army then retreated.
