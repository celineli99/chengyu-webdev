        <h2>Story in English</h2>
            <p class="story"> 
                In the state of Chu there was a man who sold weapons, and who went to the market to sell his spears and shields. <br>
                Many people came to look at them, and he raised his shield and said to everyone: "My shild is the strongest in the world, no matter how sharp a pike is, it cannot go through!" <br>
                Then the weapon seller picked up a spear and boasted: "My spear is the sharpest in the world. No matter how strong and solid a shield is, it cannot stop my spear! If the shield just touches it, then it will be immediately pierced through."
                He was very proud, and shouted again: "Come and look, come and buy the strongest shield and sharpest spear in the world!" <br>
                At that moment, a spectator took up a spear and also a shield and asked: "If I pierced this shield with that spear, then what would happen?" <br>
                "This --" stuttered the weapon seller. <br>
                The other spectators first were all shocked, then suddenly bursted out in laughter, and then went away.<br>
                The weapon seller took up his spears and shields gloomily and walked away.
