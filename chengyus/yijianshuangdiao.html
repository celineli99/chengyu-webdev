        <h2>Story in Chinese</h2>
            <p class="story"> 

                南北朝时，北周有个叫长孙晟的武将，善于射箭，又智谋超人。
                他曾被派遣护送公主到西北突厥族去成婚。
                突厥族国王摄图很器重他，把他留了下来，常让他随自己一起去打猎。一次，摄图看见两只大雕在空中争夺一块肉，便交给长孙晟两支箭，请他将雕射下来。
                长孙晟跨马前奔，拉开弓，只听嗖的一声，一箭竟穿过两只大雕的胸脯。
                雕顿时双双落下。这个成语原指射箭技术高超。现指一举两得。

        <h2>Story in English</h2>
            <p class="story"> 

                   During the Northern and Southern Dynasties, there was a general named Chang Sunsheng from the Northern Zhou Dynasty. He was very good at archery and had super-human powers.
                   He was sent to escort the princess to the Northwest Turk tribe to get married there. <br>
                   The king of the Turk tribe, She Tu, thought very highly of the general, let him stay and often allowed him to go hunting with him. <br> 
                    One time, the king saw two eagles in the air who were fighting for a piece of meat, so he gave Sunsheng two arrows and asked him to shoot the eagles down.
                    Chang Sunsheng sprinted forward, span the bow, and with only a "swish" sound, the arrow went throught he breasts of both eagles. <br>
                    Both eagles fell to the ground. <br>
                    This idiom originally meant excellent archery skills. Now it is used as "Killing two birds with one stone".
