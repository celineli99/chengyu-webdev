            <p class="story">
                春秋时候，晋国世家赵氏灭掉了范氏。有人趁机跑到范氏家里想偷点东西，看见院子里吊着一口大钟。
                钟是用上等青铜铸成的，造型和图案都很精美。小偷心里高兴极了，想把这口精美的大钟背回自己家去。
                可是钟又大又重，怎么也挪不动。他想来想去，只有一个办法，那就是把钟敲碎，然后再分别搬回家。<br>
                小偷找来一把大锤子，拼命朝钟砸去，咣的一声巨响，把他吓了一大跳。
                小偷着慌，心想这下糟了，这钟声不就等于是告诉人们我正在这里偷钟吗？
                他心里一急，身子一下子扑到了钟上，张开双臂想捂住钟声，可钟声又怎么捂得住呢！钟声依然悠悠地传向远方。<br>
                他越听越害怕，不由自主地抽回双手，使劲捂住自已的耳朵。
                “咦，钟声变小了，听不见了！”小偷高兴起来，“妙极了！把耳朵捂住不就听不进钟声了吗！
                ”他立刻找来两个布团，把耳朵塞住，心想，这下谁也听不见钟声了。于是就放手砸起钟来，一下一下，钟声响亮地传到很远的地方。人们听到钟声蜂拥而至把小偷捉住了。<br>

        <h2>Story in English</h2>
            <p class="story"> 
                In the Spring and Autumn period, the Zhao family defeated the Fan family. Someone took this opportunity to rush to the Fan family's house in order to steal something from there, and saw a big bell hanging in the yard.
                The bell was made out of bronze, with exquisite shapes and patterns, and looked quite beautiful. The thief was very happy and wanted to take that beautiful bell back home. But the clock was big and heavy and couldn't be moved. 
                The thief thought a while, and came up with the idea to smash the clock, and carry it back home piece by piece. <br>
                The thief found a large hammer, and slammed the bell with force which resulted in a loud bang.
                He was shocked and panicked, thinking to himself: "Won't this sound tell everyone that I am stealing this bell?"
                He got very anxious, and tried to embrace the bell with his body, but how could he mute the sound of the bell!
                The bell's sound continued to spread far into the distance. <br>
                The more he listened to the sound the more frightened the thief became, and he couldn't help but take his hands from the bell and cover his ears.
                "Ah, the sound is much quieter now, I cannot hear it anymore!" the thief thought happily. "That's wonderful, If you cover your ears then you won't hear the bell!"
                He immediately found some cloth and plugged his ears with them, thinking to himself that this time the sound wouldn't be heard anymore. 
                Thus, he let go of the bell and started to slam it, whilst the sound travelled far and wide. <br>
                When people heard the sound, they came and caught the thief.
